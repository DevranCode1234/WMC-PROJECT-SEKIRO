| Sek-02 | 2 | First-HTML-Page | As a gamer, I want the homepage to be easy to use. | The homepage should have an animated background. On the first Subpage there should also be a few pictures with small texts underneath. At the bottom of the website I try to link the creators of the game to their Instagram and if they have other social medias, link them too.| |

Explain the boss figths and write some cheating skills for the boss fight. |
