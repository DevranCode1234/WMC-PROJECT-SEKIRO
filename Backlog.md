| Sek-01   | 1 | The Project | As a user, I'm looking for a website where I, as a gamer, can get information about how to play Soulsgame. It should have a clear overview. | First make a plan and draw on a piece of paper what the project should look like and what game the website will be based on. | |
| Sek-02   | 2 | First-HTML-Page | As a user, I want the homepage to be easy to use and to be able to read a bit about the game. | The homepage should have an animated font. On the first page there should also be a few pictures with small texts underneath. At the bottom I try to link the creators of the game to their Instagram and if they have other social media, link them too.| |
| Sek-03   | 3 | Functions of the website | As a user, I don't want to spend too much time looking for buttons where I can access the subpage. As a gamer, I would be happy to hear sounds from the game and the theme music. | Divide the website into subpages and provide more information about the game. Game theme music should be playing in the background when you enter the website. And the buttons should also have a sound. Battle scenes from the game are also shown in the background. |  |
