| Sek-01   | 1 | The Project | As a user, I'm looking for a website where I, as a gamer, can get information about how to play Soulsgame. | First make a plan and draw on a piece of paper what the project should look like and what game the website will be based on. | |
| Sek-02   | 2 | First-HTML-Page | As a user, I want the homepage to be easy to use and to be able to read a bit about the game. | The homepage should have an animated font. On the first page there should also be a few pictures with small texts underneath. At the bottom I try to link the creators of the game to their Instagram and if they have other social media, link them too.| |
