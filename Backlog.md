| Sek-01 | 1 | The Project | As a user, I'm looking for a website where I, as a gamer, can get information about how to play Soulsgame. It should have a clear overview. | First make a plan and draw on a piece of paper what the project should look like and what game the website will be based on. | |
| Sek-02 | 2 | First-HTML-Page | As a user, I want the homepage to be easy to use. | The homepage should have an animated background. On the first Subpage there should also be a few pictures with small texts underneath. At the bottom of the website I try to link the creators of the game to their Instagram and if they have other social medias, link them too.| |
| Sek-03 | 3 | Functions of the website | As a gamer, I would be happy to hear sounds from the game and the theme music. I would also be happy to see some animated pictures | Divide the website into subpages and provide more information about the game. Game theme music should be playing in the background when you enter the website. |  |
